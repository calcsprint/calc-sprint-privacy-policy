  <h1>Privacy Policy — Calc Sprint</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>6 semptember,2025</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Calc Sprint (the “App”) is developed and published to speed up math problem solving skills</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, what Android permissions are required, and your rights as a user.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Data Collected Automatically (Local only)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>High scores and basic progress statistics (saved locally in Android SharedPreferences).</li>
    <li>App settings and preferences (such as selected difficulty and last mode used).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Personal Data</h3>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect or request any personal data such as name, phone number, email address, or location by default.</p>

  <h3>2.3 Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>The current version of the App does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or cloud storage.</p>

  <h2>3. Permissions We Request</h2>
  <p>The current version of Calc Sprint requires <strong>no dangerous permissions</strong>. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET</strong> — Not required in the current version. May be requested in the future if online leaderboards, ads, or analytics are introduced. If enabled, this permission will only be used for the stated feature and disclosed to the user.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong> — Not required in the current version. May be used later alongside Internet to check connectivity for ads/leaderboards.</li>
    <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> — Not required. The App stores progress data only in secure local preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>CAMERA / LOCATION / MICROPHONE</strong> — Not required at all. The App has no feature that uses them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In summary: Calc Sprint runs fully offline and does not request any runtime permissions from the user in its current release.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Locally stored data is used only to display your score history and restore your preferences when reopening the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No personal data is collected or shared. If optional online features are introduced in the future, they will be clearly disclosed and require user consent.</p>

  <h2>6. Children</h2>
  <p>The App is safe for children and contains only educational content. No personal data is collected from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Deletion & User Rights</h2>
  <p>All stored data is local. You can delete it anytime by uninstalling the App or clearing its data in your device settings.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use standard Android security mechanisms (private app storage, SharedPreferences). No sensitive personal data is handled in this version.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If permissions or features change, this Privacy Policy will be updated and the new “Effective date” will be shown here. Users may be prompted to accept new terms when required by law or Google Play policies.</p>
